# 📘 LeetCode Journal

A structured journal of **LeetCode problems** I solve, focused on building strong fundamentals in **Data Structures and Algorithms** through clear explanations, pattern recognition, and consistent practice.

This repository is intended to be a long-term learning resource rather than a collection of copied solutions.
